## Description ##

This is a Proof of Concept game, mostly for myself.

The goal is to create a functional game using the [LibGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) Java game library with the polished elegance of Ruby thanks to [JRuby](http://jruby.org/).

## Set up ##

**Requirements**

You need the following (please refer to their specific installation guidelines)

- Java SE Runtime Environment 1.6 or 1.7
- jruby 1.7.11 (I recommend to install it with [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) or [RVM](http://rvm.io/))
- [bundler gem](https://github.com/bundler/bundler)

Then run:

    bundle install

## Running ##

    jruby main.rb

## Building ##

**This is broken at the moment**

You will need JRuby as a JAR before you can start building. You can get it with:

    rawr install

Now you can build an executable JAR

    rake rawr:jar

Or a Mac OSX app

    rake rawr:bundle:app

Or a Windows executable

    rake rawr:bundle:exe

Builds can be found in the `build` directory.

Kudos to the following, without which this project would not exist.

- [JRuby](http://jruby.org/) ([EPL/GPL/LGPL](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/blob/master/COPYING))

  For providing the power of Java through the elegancy of Ruby.

- [libGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) ([Apache 2 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html))

  An awesome open-source Java gaming library.

  Cool assets made available to everyone.

  Also this great repository that compiles up assets neatly: [Universal LPC spritesheet](https://github.com/makrohn/Universal-LPC-spritesheet).

- Peter Cooper and his ["Letâ€™s Build a Simple Video Game with JRuby: A Tutorial" article](http://www.rubyinside.com/video-game-ruby-tutorial-5726.html) that sparked the initial flame.
